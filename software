Public domain. This is the most permissive type of software license. It means that anyone can modify and use the software without any restrictions. But you should always make sure it’s secure before adding it to your own codebase. Note that code that doesn’t have a license is NOT automatically in the public domain.

Permissive. Permissive licenses are also known as “Apache style” or “BSD style.” They contain minimal requirements about how the software can be modified or redistributed. This type of software license is perhaps the most common and popular with free and open source software. Aside from Apache and BSD, another common variant is the MIT License.
